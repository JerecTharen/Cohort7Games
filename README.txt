This is a collaborative effort of the Cohort 7 Web Developement class. The objective is to have a space to practice
what we learn in class in an environment similar to what we will encounter in the workspace. Each Game and area of
the site is meant to be it's own branch on GitHub with either one student or a team of them working on it.
